# 335-Fall2018-Devices-Information-App
# OOP C++
Design an OOP program that can be used to create, update and read a file, which contains data about devices and tests/measurements to be performed on these devices.
Your program should create and use a Device class to store and process the device data, such as a device description and its serial number. The program should also use a Test class to store and process the test data, such as a test description, a number of months between two tests, the date of the most recent test, and the date of the next test. The program should get all necessary data from the user except the date of the next test, which will be computed by the program. The Test class should contain a function that will compute the date of the next test using the date of the last test and the number of months between two tests. Your program should also create and use a third class that will inherit the Device and Test classes. This class should contain all necessary functions to write and read the device and test data into/from a file.

The program should enable the user to:

- Create a file and store the device and its test records/data into the file

- Search for a specific device in the file using its serial number and display all its
testsâ€™ records

- Search for a specific date and display all devices that have to be tested on this date

Program requirements: 
It is required to use the following C++ language constructs/tools:
1. File I/O
2. Inheritance
3. Operator functions (at least two)
4. Constructor functions
5. Error checking and handling
